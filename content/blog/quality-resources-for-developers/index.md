## Table of Contents

If you're anything like me, you're always on the hunt for a website or resource that pumps out very high quality content such as tips and tricks, guides, or even showing off cool things that are achievable in the most basic languages *(like complex animations in CSS - god how I wish I could do that)* ðŸ˜® 

These resources are absolutely fantastic as they're a low-effort high-reward way to ensure you're continously growing every day as a developer.

- Low-effort because it's all on a single website, or very few websites
- High-reward because just learning 2-3 of these articles every day, ensures you're at least 1% better than you were the day before.

Here is a little curated list of some of the resources I check daily, and I recommend you do too! Let's get into it ðŸš€ 

## Websites

A bunch of high quality websites that I recommend bookmarking.

### Daily.dev

Not specifically a website, but if you head over to their [website](https://daily.dev/) you'll be prompted to add a browser extension which adds an amazing dynamic new-tab page full of ever changing content!

ðŸ”¥ Update: They now have a website version that you can bookmark: [app.daily.dev](https://app.daily.dev/)
